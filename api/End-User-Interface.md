# Welcome to Writage!

Writage is a plugin for Microsoft Word, which enables you to create and edit
Markdown files (with .md extension) in convenient visual interface. It can also
save your .docx files in plain text format with Markdown markup.

The option of copying selected rich-text as Markdown, and pasting Markdown as
rich-text is also supported.

This document shows Markdown markup styles supported in Writage. Please feel
free to edit it—a fresh copy is always available via Writage menu.

## Inline Formatting

To apply *emphasis* or **strong emphasis** please select some text and press
Italic button (use Ctrl+I shortcut) or Bold button (Ctrl+B) in Word. Press again
to turn it off.

## Footnotes

Notes can be placed anywhere[^1] in the document, press **References/Insert
Footnote** (or Alt+Ctrl+F) to insert one. Footnotes are displayed at the bottom
of the corresponding page.

[^1]: Yes, right here.

## Quotes

To style some text as a quote apply style “Quote” from the styles. Quotes are
displayed inside the document with the left margin.

## Hyperlinks

Press **Insert/Link/ Insert Link** (or Ctrl+K) to insert a hyperlink. It can be
either literal URL (<http://www.google.com/>) or have some
[text](http://www.google.com/). Click URL with Ctrl key pressed to open it in
web browser.

## Code blocks

Inline `code` gets monospaced font.

```
Verbatim blocks use monospaced font as well and preserve line
breaks
```

In order to apply code block style from Word a “Source Code” style should be
created first.

## Lists

-   First bulleted item.

-   Second bulleted item.

Lists can be styled via pressing **Bullets** or **Numbering** button or using
autoformatting: type minus and space for bulleted item or “1”, point and space
for numbered item.

1.  First numbered item.

2.  Second numbered item.

## Tables

Press **Insert/Table** to create a table of required size, or use pop-up menu to
add more columns or rows. Here is a sample table.

| **Features** | **Editable in Word** |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Basic Styles | Yes                  |
