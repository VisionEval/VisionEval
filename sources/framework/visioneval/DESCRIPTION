Description: This package defines all of the functions used to implement the
    VisionEval model system which defines a system and establishes a software
    framework for developing and implementing models that support the
    development of disaggregate strategic planning models for transportation,
    land use, and related topics. Models are built out of loosely-coupled
    modules (submodels) that are contained within R packages. A module
    incorporates model parameters, input and output data specifications, and
    functions that carry out model calculations. Modules interact by passing
    data to and from a common datastore. A user builds a model from modules by
    writing a simple R script which initializes the model and calls the modules
    in the desired order. This package provides the software framework for
    initializing and managing the model run environment, managing the common
    datastore, and running modules.
