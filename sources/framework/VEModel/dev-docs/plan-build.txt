For installing models

  Add optional "package" argument to limit search for installable models to a particular package

  Allow a module to have a "TestWith" specification, using when we "make tests" - auto-run one or
  more models and keep track of when that run occurred relative to the most recent packages in
  ve-lib. Create a "test" folder. TestWith specifies a model to install and run. May be a local
  model within the package, or a general model (for standard module packages).

  Create a "tests" target in the Makefile that runs build-tests.R script (new) that installs and
  runs the test models. In build-config, need to parse the TestWith directive (and clean out the
  prior testing). The tests target can only run after a successful module build.

  Put the version number in VE-Config.yml and package version numbers in VEComponents.yml. Use
  that version to mark the installer name. Use the package version numbers (if defined) to
  replace the ones in the package DESCRIPTION.

Implement the TestWith approach to system testing

  Specify package as well as model + variant for installModel
  Add a "private" indicator to a model configuration so it doesn't appear in the end user list
    (but can still be found directly)
  Ambiguous model variants (e.g. "test" in multiple modules)
  Specify a model to use to test a module (or the framework)
  De-duplicate if multiple modules use the same model variant
  Load and run the model
  Add "Stage" to model-index.cnf so we can locally just specify what is different.
    Specify Package, Model, Variant
    Then make everything that follows into a subdirectory stage for that model

Multicore improvements for the build process itself

  Allow the build process to be a "multi-core"/parallel activity (with the dependency groups of the
  packages set up so we build independent modules in parallel) - how to handle logging the outputs
  of each - possible enlarging how the build log is maintained - use sink to re-route standard output
  and perhaps standard error (risky) to a file specific to each "future". Enable multi-tasking by setting
  number of available workers (via environment/Makefile variable) to something more than one.
    - Factor out the build steps into a function.
    - Loop over the build creating futures (okay to block)
    - With only one worker, skip the future - just run the function

Issues for ve.build / Makefile / new Github architecture

- Reorganize runtime libraries (set up for new module sequence below)

  # Change the runtime build to have two libraries, not one:
    1. the package dependencies (which can be auto-installed from the internet, if available, or
    included in an offline installer), and
    2. the VE package library (with just installed VE-packages).
  # Could then give people three things they can install:
    1. Bare VisionEval (just ve-lib, which will pull down dependencies from the internet into
       runtime-lib if runtime-lib is not present)
    2. Runtime library (which can be installed into local runtime-lib)
    3. Src folder (installed into local 'src' folder for debugging)

  # We're probably stuck still distributing vast datasets for (re-)estimation.
    1. Could change the distribution so that users can download (into their ve.runtime/local folder)
       the estimation data for packages so they only have to retrieve it if they expect to re-estimate.
    2. So we leave that crap out of the ve-lib built package (just keep estimation results in data
       directory). Local estimation always revolves around ve.runtime/local, even if using the
       package data.
    3. Change the build to create a zip file with ALL the estimation data (but nicer to allow users
       to download only what they need).
    4. So we bundle estimation data by package into the estimation zip deliverable (that will create
       local/<packages>/estimation-data).

- Module build sequence
    
  # Rething what is the "framework" versus "modules":
    # Build visioneval (factor it back out as "framework" versus module)
    # Build NHTS package
      # Move it down into the "framework" directory (not a "module") on the Github
      # Goes into the VEBase-lib (not distributed)
      # Could provide alternate NHTS packages with different data, or let the user
        inject their own package (with the same standard name).
      # The package they supply gets installed under a standard name (altering Description, for
        example) in VEBase-lib and then used later by all the other modules.
      # Could expand this to also include a package for the Smart Location Database
      # Could further extend to make
    # Build VEModel package (used to run module tests)
      # Move this into the "framework" directory as well (not a "module") so it can
        be used to support the build (in particular the new build-test.R build script)
      # Has its own "tests" moment (unit-testing during package build)
      # But also gets exercised in the later build-test.R script
    # all of those go into VEBase-lib (see above)
    # VEBase-lib gets distributed
      # User can override NHTS and SLD (which are "data only") by providing
        local.data/NHTS or local.data/SLD
  # .libPaths() includes dev-lib and build-lib when building modules
  # Module packages have the following build elements:
    # What is in the Github is NOT a buildable R package; instead it is a set of
      materials that get copied/built into the built/visioneval/4.1.2/src folder.
      Actual package building happens from the "src" folder.
    # Process raw-data/ into src/data/
      # Not stuck to that name: the data in the module is for raw estimation
      # raw-data is optional; may cut straight to estimation data
      # Key distinction is that raw-data generates stuff needed (possibly at runtime)
        to run local data estimation: it is not specific to a locale
    # Module scripts should be self-contained with standard function names
      # Specify<Module>
        Just creates the specifications in data/
      # Estimate<Module>
        Function can be called within VisionEval runtime if the user provides
        local.data/Package/module/raw-data (compare dates and time and re-estimate if present and
        newer) and builds into local.data/Package/module/data.
        There should be VEModel function for that purpose.
        Otherwise reads Github raw-data (estimation-data) and builds into src/data/
      # <Module> (or perhaps even "Run<Module>" and let the Framwork spin up the name)
        The code that gets called from RunModule
      # Module must not create any global objects other than those three functions
      # May have other functions:
        # Format standard data source (puts results into ve.runtime/local.data)
          ve.runtime/local.data is organized by Package and Module
          Takes downloaded data and builds it into ve.runtime/local.data
        # Change framework function to look up module data/ so it looks first for
          local.data/Package/Module/dataset, then in the package's data/ folder
          Use that consistently throughout the modules.
        # Perhaps a shadow help system for VE that enables the user to browse
          HTML documentation on the module. Or include a vignette
        # Copy module R scripts into the "src/R" folder
    # Should also have the option DURING THE GITHUB BUILD to inject local estimation data
      # So if we have a "local-data" folder (like the optional runtime one) with Package
        sub-directory, it will provide the estimation data to use rather than the stuff included in
        raw-data/estimation-data. File names will be the same.
      # That folder will be provided with a ReadMe file in the Github but populated in the
        user's local computer (and perhaps committed to their fork).
      # So buildx from local data has two places it can happen
        # 
    # Run module estimation function(s) to generate default module estimates in src/data/
      # Do NOT put big data files into inst/extdata; they live in the Github in raw-data
        May have 
      # Can look at raw-data subdirectory for default materials
      # Function has input directory parameter (looks in raw-data or estimation-data)
      # Function has output directory (data/ during build; later the user's data location)
    # Run module specification functions(s) to generate module specifications in data/
`     # Need to rethink the role and content of the Package "Initialize" function
    # Copy the models/ directory from the module on the Github to src/inst/models/
    # Build documentation
      # Build vignettes and function documentation
        # Change the module_docs to build a vignette (src/docs) for the module
        # should document:
          Input data
          Estimation mechanisms
          Runtime requirements (Input/Output)
          What the module does to transform Input to Output
          Helper functions (format estimation data)
          Functions available for module
          (Note: can use the framework module_docs builder to do that)
        # May also build from vignettes folder in the Github (e.g. for other
          vignettes beyond the module documentation
      # Build into src/docs and src/man
      # Can be built around devtools::document
    # Copy Github "tests/" directory into src/tests
      # These will optionally run using VisionEval/VEModel as part of the package building
      # Conducted if the TESTS build/Makefile flag is set, otherwise skipped
      # Tests should be minimal for sanity - unit tests on the module
      # Existing Framework testModule could be rewritten and used to do that
      # Unit tests should only depend on the framework and current package code
    # Run collate and namespace generation on src/ folder
    # Check and build src/ into R source and binary package
      # Load finished pacakges into the VE package reposotory
      # Install the finished packages into ve-lib (for Windows binary installer)
      # Run installed package tests, if provided, as optional part of package build
        # Uses R package build test function, on src/tests constructed optionally above
        # Tests are copied into src/tests from the Github package/tests/build
        # Also (see next item) on Github is package/tests/runtime
  # Distinct from building modules, have a "build-test-models.R" step
    # Separate Makefile target "runtime-tests" depending on a full runtime having been built
    # Optional step
    # Finds each package that has "models/" folder, and uses VEModel to install and
      run each model
    # Gracefully handle "bare" model variants - put a flag in model-config that says
      "Not-Run" like R examples.

- RunScript directive implementation

  # Looks for its resources in a magic "package" called LocalScripts that is built into
    ve.runtime/local.data/LocalScripts/ScriptName
    # Uses the "search for local.data" process that we will retrofit into existing modules
  # Script has same structure as a Module
    At a minimum, a function with the ModuleName
    Can have a Specify<ModuleName> function
    Can have an Estimate<ModuleName> function
    The script will use the local.data/LocalScript/ScriptName directory to seek its raw-data/
    and to generate is data/
  # When performing RunScript:
    # If there is an Estimate function make sure that local.data/.../data is up to date, using
      local.data/.../raw-data as the input directory
    # If there is a Specifications function, run that into local.data/.../data if the latter is
      not up-to-date
    # Look at a run parameter for a flag to force rebuild of local scripts (otherwise use them
      if they are present and up-to-date).
    # Then run the script in the framework, passing the "L" parameter and receiving the "Out_ls"
      results.
  # If we get that right, the module script can later just be picked up and dropped into a Github
    source for a module package (along with its default raw-data) and it will "just work"
  # However, there is no requirement that a script be complete - it doesn't have to use the L
    parameter (though it must specify it) and without any Specifications, nothing comes out of
    it (it returns an empty list() for Out_ls). Inside, it can call framework functions to
    directly access the Datastore. It CANNOT call VEModel (since VEModel may not be available
    when performing a low-level ModelStage run - the sole dependencies for that are (1) running in
    the same file system; and (2) visioneval framework package is available.
  # A RunScript will be sought in by <FunctionName>.R in the model's scripts directory
  # It can do things entirely unrelated to the model (does not need to access the Datastore, but
    it can, either through the Specification method or by dipping manually into the Datastore -
    see the sample code in the proto-query development that created MedianHouseholdIncome based
    on the household size).
