Description: This package contains modules which predict household vehicle
    ownership, including the number owned, body types, and ages. It also
    identifies car service accessibility by household (High & Low) and
    substitutes car service (e.g. car sharing or transportation network company)
    for owning a household vehicle for households that have a high level of car
    service availability and the cost of owning a car per mile of travel is
    higher than the cost per mile of using a car service. The cost of owning
    vehicles is calculated as a function of the vehicle age, type, and vehicle
    miles traveled.
