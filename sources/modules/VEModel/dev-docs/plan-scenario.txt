## Rethink on loading scenarios:

# Load the RunParameters for the ScenarioDir (if no scenario dir, then no scenarios)
  - Overlay onto base model run parameters

# Set the StartFrom for the scenarios (from the base model).
  - Explicit StartFrom in the ScenarioDir/visioneval.cnf
  - Implicit StartFrom as the last Reportable stage in the base model
# Load te


###### Deeper architecture follows:

Set up a stock model variant VERSPM variant="scenario" which installs a couple of scenario
variant folders - one a ModelStages version that emulates the in-memory version we'll build in
tests/test.R, and one a Category version that uses the setup from the old VERSPM-scenarios. The
model should also include queries for making visualizer-friendly metrics.

Need a model stage scenario variant that includes altered input files. Test needs to ensure
that InputPath is being implemented correct for the stages.

So the sample model needs:
  1. ScenarioDir for ModelStages
  2. ScenarioDir for CategoryStages
  3. Queries directory with a sample query emulating metrics from original VERSPM metrics
  4. Base it on the VERSPM-pop variant
  5. Maybe do a pair of variants: one for "scenario-stages" and one for "scenario-categories"
  6. They just copy different scenario dir (with different visioneval.cnf and sub-folders)
  7. Same test data can get copied into each

Things to put into the scenario test:
  1. In-memory stages added (addstage should let us push it into the file but also the memory
     RunParam_ls)
     Visualizer: see each stage added to master "Scenarios" Category/Scenario, and the stage
     becomes its own level
  1. Adjust in-memory stages to add an explicit category to them
     Visualier: see two categories instead of one
  2. ScenarioDir with ModelStages descriptions of scenarios (same as In-Memory except we've
     added those specific stages plus StartFrom to the ScenarioDir visioneval.cnf)
     Visualizer: Should have explicit Categories? or not? Won't differ much from the earlier
  3. ScenarioDir with Category/Scenario descriptions - spins up 
     Visualizer: Check for full elaboration of Category/Scenario structure with a bunch of
     scenarios

Need to finish scenario construction and stage building, and handle all the ways stages can be
visualized - get the visualizer working first for a set of 1 or more reportable stages and a set of
measures from that stage (via running a VEQuery on it). Then expand out to more refined types of
Categories and Scenarios (combination build, including StartFrom).

When we process scenario ModelStages that were build from Category/Scenario, we need to keep the
list of Scenario/Level for each set of results. The StartFrom stage goes in as a stage where all the
Levels are set to zero (the "base case"). Levels are only defined for inputs that deviate. Scenarios
are only built for Categories (which map over to Scenarios). Categories can be made for manual
scenarios (see below).

If we add a new Category or a new Level (e.g. by way of a new Scenario) we should not have to re-run
everything. If a new Category appears, we just mark the ModelStage for all the other built stages as
having Level=0 for that Category so we're done (if a Category/Level is not part of the list of how a
ModelState scenario was defined, we presume it is Level=0). If a new Level appears, we will build
that Category/Level scenario in combination with all others and just do the additional stages that
for combinations of the new Level. Likewise, if we drop a Category (for export or otherwise), we
just ignore its components and do not build model stages for it.

That suggests that the built name of scenarios for Category/Level should not include explicit
reference to Level=0 - if the Category/Level was not used for the scenario, the implication is that
it is the base state. That also means we don't explicitly have to assign Category/Level to the
StartFrom stage since the default for all Categories is Level=0.

When we are tagging scenario ModelStages for use in the VEData structure for the Visualizer, we look
at what Categories are requested for the Visualization (default = all defined categories) and we
only pull scenarios for combinations of the requested Category/Levels (there will always be a "zero
level" for the missing Category where we just vary the others). So the build tree of category/level
looks like this:

expand.grid does what we need, but must have the zero level explicit (we drop it again)

StartFrom
C1/L1
C1/L2
C2/L1 (level 0 for C1)
C2/L2
C2/L3
C3/L1
C1/L1/C2/L1 (inclues level 0 for C3)
C1/L1/C2/L1/C3/L1
C1/L2/C2/L1
C1/L2/C2/L1/C3/L1
C1/L1/C2/L2
C1/L1/C2/L2/C3/L1
C1/L2/C2/L2
C1/L2/C2/L2/C3/L1
C1/L1/C2/L3
C1/L1/C2/L3/C3/L1
C1/L2/C2/L3
C1/L2/C2/L3/C3/L1

So we just do stages for (just)
                levels of the first category (L1 stages)
Then stages for levels of second category (L2 stages)
Then stages for levels of third category (L3 stages)
Then stages for levels of first category plus second category (L1 * L2 stages)
Then stages for levels of first category plus third category (L1 * L3 stages)
Then stages for levels of first category plus second plus third category (L1 * L2 * L3 stages)
Then stages for levels of second category plus third category (L2 * L3 stages)

If we add another Category with L4 levels we'll just do another version of each of those stages
with all combinations of L4 levels, as well as the L4 levels alone. The permutations go up fast,
but keeping track is easy, and we don't have to rename or redefine anything to run.

We do need to look at the indexing in the Visualizer and make sure we generate the categories
with the initial Level 0 into categoryconfig. It's all keyed off the Name so we should be good.

VEModel Adjustments

  - Need to update the "dir" and "clear" functions for the model to manage queries. QueryDir
    contains query templates. They are not managed by "clear" which looks only at results.
    Need to recognize queries in the ResultsDir and treat those like log files with respect to
    listing and clearing. Clearing results will take out the QueryRun-*.Rda along with Logs.
    The Query outputs are .Rda files called QueryRun-<QueryName>.Rda where the QueryName is
    same one that was loaded to run the query.
  - VEQuery uses an attached model to manage query results (and we can call up results - which
    internally calls run if there are no results yet). Do VEQuery$results to get results (report "No
    Model" if a model is not attached; report "Model run status: X" if the model is not "Run
    Complete").
  - Accessing a query through a model automatically attaches the model. Otherwise use
    VEQuery$model(VEModel object) to attach. Opional Save parameter will create QueryDir for the
    model (if it doesn't exist) and save to VEQuery name if there is no corresponding .VEqry yet.
  - Archiving Results should also archive query results (like Log files) - and outputs should also
    probably come along for the ride generally.
  - Copying a model has the option to copy its results and dataset. If we have the model name in
    the results ModelState.Rda, it needs to change, as does the ModelDir and everything derived from
    it - that's also the case with just archiving the results (make sure RunPath is correct - the
    archive should look just like results that were genereated if ResultsDir = ArchiveDir).
  - Suggests we need a function to operate on the ModelState and fix everything up (certain
    parameters get replaced and rebuilt).

Run ModelStage Punch List:

  - When we run a ModelStage, we need to save key features of the ModelStage into the ModelState.Rda
    In particular, we want to keep the Scenario/Level list. The RunParam_ls for the ModelStage
    (if it was built as a scenario) should include the "Scenario/Level" descriptors as
    built when we identify scenarios - that's the "ScenarioConfig" key described below. Any
    ModelStage that is a scenario needs to have that key.

Setting up scenario ModelStages:

  - For manual scenarios, the ModelStage should include a "Category" key, referring to the
    "Categories" tag (which should only contain "NAME", "LABEL" and "DESCRIPTION", not "LEVELS").
    If there is no Category key, it gets a default one called "Scenarios". If there are Category
    keys but no "Categories" tag, build the latter from whatever is present (at a minimum, a
    "Scenarios" category).

  - If no "Scenarios" tag, but "Categories" exists, use that to classify any manual scenarios - drop
    any Categories that are not referred to by any of the defined ModelStages. If the "Levels"
    element of "Categories" is provided, only include the scenario ModelStages listed there (by
    their ModelStage Name) and give it Level=1. The default is to include all scenario model stages
    as levels in the corresponding Category if no levels are defined for the Category.

  - If "Scenarios" tag exists but no Categories, just do a one-to-one mapping from "Scenarios"
    to "Categories". Name and Description are elevated from the Scenario Label and Description
    respectively, and the Category levels just track over to the Scenario/Level list from
    "Scenarios". Amounts to renaming "Scenarios" into "Categories"

  - If no "Categories" and "Scenarios" are pre-defined:
      - "Categories" and "Scenarios" tags will be created as the set of unique "Category" tags in
        each Reportable ModelStage (if no "Category" tag, create a default Category="Scenarios")
      - Each reportable ModelStage:
        - Adds a Scenario/Level to the scenarios list (NAME=Scenario Name/Dir, LEVEL=1)
        - Adds a Category/Level (or just a level to the Categories table)
          - If the stage has no Category, its category is "Scenarios"
          - If the stage category does not exist it is created in the categories table
          - The stage is appended to the list of category levels (NAME = next available number)
          - The Category level only has one scenario (NAME=ModelStage name, LEVEL=1)

  - If there are both "Categories" and "Scenarios" defined
      - "Categories" must contain "LEVELS", which is a list of the defined NAME and LEVEL from
        the "Scenarios" tag
      - FILES tag goes on "Scenarios", not "Categories" in the visualizer scheme.
      - The Scenario Name/Level is sought as an input folder in ScenarioDir (paste0(Name,Level))
        Input path for the Scenario/Level is the corresponding input folder. Description for
        the Scenario/Level is placed in the "Scenarios" tag.
      - We build model stages from combinations of Category/Level (where each Category/Level
        supplies the vector of InputPaths from its Scenario/Level elements as well as the structure
        that identifies the active set of Scenario/Level for that Scenario ).
          - Visit all the Scenario/Levels and add InputPath (normalized) and Level NAME
          - When building a ModelStage for a combination of Category/Level, add the InputPaths
            of all the Scenario/Levels in the Category/Levels and accumulate a named vector of
            Scenario/Level
          - A special "Level 0" is added to the front of the list of Category/Levels, with
            description "Base Conditions" and Name "0"
      - The StartFrom stage is also tagged: it is tagged with level zero for each possible
        Scenario entry

Extracting information from ModelStages:

  - When building a ModelStage from scenario categories, add a "ScenarioConfig" tag to RunParam_ls
    which is a list of items with the following elements:
      Name
      Level
    Build the Scenario name by concatenating the selected NameLevel for each scenario element. The
    combinations are composed by permuting the Scenario/Level listed for the category levels.
    The defined levels in the scenario configuration file will be numbered starting from 1,
    but there will be a folder with the scenario name joined to the level number for each level
    of 1 or greater.

  - The only thing we're interested in for creating a runnable stage is the Dir/Name for the
    ModelStage (build by concatenating the Name+Level for each scenario component) and the InputPath
    (build by concatenating the normalized directory path for each ScenarioName-Level) and setting
    the StartFrom, which comes from the overall ScenarioDir/visioneval.cnf or from
    "CategorySettings" within that file. Generally, the overall StartFrom will refer to a ModelStage
    in the base model, whereas a stage set in CategorySettings is expected to be a folder-based
    scenario within ScenarioDir - because StartFrom is only processed after the stages have been
    loaded (as they are evaluated as "runnable"), it doesn't matter which place "StartFrom" refers
    to: any runnable ModelStage defined in either place will work (except that in the Category
    world, the stage does need to be a folder stage - i.e. not one of the auto-generated ones).

  - Add tose tags retroactively (with Level=0 through all the scenario categories) to the
    StartFrom ModelStage.

  - When exporting data from this scenario for the Visualizer, put out these columns ahead of the
    query values:
    "Scenario" : RunParam_ls$Scenario // composed name of this scenario combining category pieces
    "ScenarionName" : ScenarioLevel
    // dump the ScenarioConfig tag, using Name (ideally one character) and Level (one
    // character)

  - When exporting the "scenarioconfig" descriptor for the Visualizer, put out the structure
    for that file. Note that the Level always includes the StartFrom stage as the first level.
    So what we need to define in ScenarioDir/visioneval.cnf are just the "extra" levels (so
    there may only be one additional level defined there).
     {
        "NAME": Scenario$Name
        "LABEL": Scenario$Label
        "DESCRIPTION": Scenario$OverallDescription
        "LEVELS": [
          {
            "NAME": "0", // auto-generated "no-build"; adds nothing to InputPath
            "LABEL": "Base",
            "DESCRIPTION": ["Base Scenario"] // auto-generated
          },
          {  // For example... This and subsequent are defined in "Scenario Land"
            "NAME": "1",
            "LABEL": "Double divesion",
            "DESCRIPTION": ["Increase diversion of SOV tours to 20%"]
          }
        ]
      },

  - Generate the output config from the QuerySpecification (just dumping description for up to the
    first N measures)

  - Generate the category config from the scenario's category descripion (including map to the
    Scenario/Level elements for each config level.  We'll only generate scenario combinations as
    needed to do come up with one scenario for each combination of category level (not each
    combination of scenario level). The Category config needed by the visualizer is pretty much
    a dump of the (possibly augmented/auto-generated) "Categories" structure in the scenario
    configuration.

=== Earlier notes follow

Changes to scenario setup to support visualizer:
  Rename the basic unit of scenario input as "Scenarios"
  Rename the units used to build model runs as "Categories"
    When we generate the combinations, they are combinations of Category levels
    The Category levels map to a set of Scenario Levels
      For each category level, add the corresponding scenario levels to the full scenario config
  Those are both configured for "category" scenarios
  Also have CategorySettings as below
  If folders that are not Scenarios exist, ignore them if Category/Scenarios are defined
  ModelStages can be created, but they are ignored if they do not have a CATEGORY defined
    They can still be used as a StartFrom (instead of overall StartFrom), so the base scenario can
    be included as one of the scenarios - and a stage named "StartFrom" will automatically get
    tagged as LEVEL:0 for each defined CATEGORY. If the explicit model stage does have a CATEGORY,
    that category must not be used by non-ModelStage scenarios and it must not have pre-defined
    levels. Each ModelStage will be assigned a LEVEL inside the CATEGORY. If there are no
    Scenario/Category definitions (i.e. only ModelStage scenarios), then a CATEGORY is automatically
    created for each ModelStage with the value "Scenarios".
  There must be a StartFrom for the Scenarios (effectively, the BaseModel)
    It can be a ModelStage within the Scenarios Folder, or a stage in the model to which
    the scenarios are attached.
  When building categories, auto-generate a Level 0 that has an empty InputPath for that Scenario
    In practice, we inject a Scenario Level without an InputPath
    Which suggests that before we do the permutations, we just turn each Scenario into its InputPath
      so what we're permuting and adding up is just the list of InputPaths (with a record of the
      corresponding scenario so we create a Scenario/Level tag).
    If there is a StartFrom stage, we tag that one with "Level 0" for each defined Scenario.
    The ModelStage contains a named character vector of scenario levels (Scenario$NAME: Level$NAME).
  Suggests that we want to augment the VEModelStage objects to include Scenario/Level that was
    used to generate each one (needed to make VEdata for visualizer for filtering results).

For building Category scenarios

  Do combinations of "Category" (not "Scenario")
    For each Category Level included, add the input path to each configured Scenario.
    Permute the Categories, but add the InputPath from each Scenario to the resulting model stage.
  Load up the defined "Categories" (which map the "Scenarios)
  So load up the defined "Scenarios" (Files/Levels/Input directories)

For visualization:

  If "Category" is defined
    Do category scenario stages
    Ignore Scenario model stages even if they exist
  If only "ModelStages" (either explicit or implicit)
    Auto-generate a single Category called "Scenarios"
      NAME is just a digit
      It has one level per defined scenario (INPUTS link to scenario NAME)
    The "Scenarios" table has components built from ModelStages
      NAME (of Scenario folder)
      LABEL (NAME of Scenario folder)
      DESCRIPTION (DESCRIPTION of Scenario folder)
      CATEGORY: "Scenarios"
    Does not have FILES
    Has only one LEVEL
      NAME (same as Scenario NAME)
      LABEL (same as Scenario NAME)
      DESCRIPTION (same as Scenario DESCRIPTION)

Basic scenario operation:
  We can have multiple sets of scenarios - set ScenarioDir in the Model's visioneval.cnf
  Scenarios are just an alternate place/means of constructing model stages
    Look for ScenarioDir and if found, process model stages from its visioneval.cnf (if any)
  Inside ScenarioDir:
    If visioneval.cnf:
      Provides defaults (notably StartFrom) applied to ALL scenarios
        Includes both Folders/ModelStages and Categories/Levels constructed from Scenarios/Levels
        StartFrom can also be a CategorySetting instead
          (and be an explicit ModelStage within the ScenarioDir)
      if ModelStages explicit in ScenarioDir/visioneval.cnf
        Process those as regular model stages
      THEN, if Categories tag present, build those Categories into model stages
        Include Optional CategorySettings (source: "CategorySettings")
          Used as RunParams_ls (overlaid on overall scenario parameters)
        Categories tag is an array of descriptors plus levels (visualizer top level)
          Each level contains a list of Scenario/Level descriptions from the Scenarios tag
          Name/LevelName for the scenarios to include
        Scenarios tag is an array of Scenarios:
          Name (short/distinct), Label, Description, Instructions
          Files (array of files from model to include in Category)
          Levels (array of levels)
            Name, Label, Description
    If no visioneval.cnf or if no ModelStages and no Categories in visioneval.cnf:
      Process any sub-folders as if they were model stages defined in the base model
      Just read their visioneval.cnf (and screen out non-runnable ones as usual)

When we load ScenarioDir, we create a VEModelScenarios object
  That object is used to provide the descriptors for 
    ModelStages (tagged with the Category/level they belong to)

Write a function for the VEModelScenarios object 

Add category, file and level interrogation (VEModelScenarios object).
Intersect files from basemodel and categories (which files are in which categories)

  VEModelScenarios object
    Can manipulate visioneval.cnf for VEScenarios object using standard environment tools.
      Has a RunParam_ls and a loadedParam_ls elements
    Can construct stages (build them on the fly if not already prepared; see above)
      Rebuild/Revalidate categories (all+only the files; present in all levels) when making stages
    Printing the scenarios object will show the stages that are defined
      Will show Categories, Files, Levels if defined

  Need to set:
    StartFrom stage in base model (default is last Reportable, can provide non-character to ignore)
    ScenarioDir (where to look for scenario configuration, inputs)
  If ScenarioDir (default="scenarios" relative to ModelDir) exists:
    - Look for ScenarioConfig defaulting to "scenarios.cnf";
    - If ScenarioDir contains scenarios.cnf, that file will be opened and the keys "Categories" (optional)
      and "Scenarios" will be sought in it.
  The Scenarios key contains:
    StartFrom (the stage that the scenarios will start from; must be Reportable)
      - May be NULL (scenarios are free-standing runnable model stages)
      - Even without StartFrom, InputPath for Scenarios will still include InputPath
        for Model if the model has an InputPath
      - So the scenarios can still just have the subset of inputs that are different
    ModelStages (definitions of ModelStages)
      - These can be constructed manually, built (loading available directories, or built
        from Category/Level configuration)
      - Reportable will be ignored (always TRUE)
      - StartFrom can be specified (or NULL) for each ModelStage
      - Any settings for the stage Config are always inline for Category-Level Scenarios
      - Free-standing scenarios from directories can have a visioneval.cnf, which is read
        just as for standard model stages
  The Categories key (if present, along with the Scenarios key) contains:
    Name, Description
    Levels, each element of which contains a Scenario/Level pair (by Name)
    We do combinations of the Categories to generate the ModelStages, picking just
      those scenarios and levels that correspond to the Category.
  The Scenarios key (if present, along with Categories key) contains:
    A list of Scenarios (by Key)
      with Name, Description
    Within each category:
      Levels
        List of Levels (by Key) with Name, Description
      Files
        List of input files (name only) to be changed for this Category
        Each level for the category gets those files (from StartFrom stage)

The scenarios become "part" of the model they are attached to. The model (baseModel) is kept as part
of the scenario management object, so certain model functions (like reloading the model or running
the scenarios) can be performed by acting on the set of scenarios.

TODO: develop VEModelScenario$add function to add a manual scenario; creates a folder
  and drops visioneval.cnf into it (with InputPath set) pivoting off BaseModel/StartFrom.
TODO: add nuance to "files" function; if we're doing manual scenarios, then we need
  to add a Files key to visioneval.cnf for the manual scenario - those will be copied
  if present when we build the scenario (but unchanged if they already exist - eventually
  compare the files to the BaseModel/InputPath version).
  Files key in visioneval.cnf will be loaded and saved.
  If the Files key exists, those are the "scenario files" - so the files function
    should have a flag to indicate what category or scenario we're getting the files
    for (and which levels have files, and which are different from each other and the
    BaseModel/StartFrom stage).

[DONE] The model's "$scenarios" function returns a VEModelScenarios object
  Pointer to the BaseModel
  StartFrom stage
  ScenarioDir (relative to model$modelPath, snapshot of BaseModel$setting("ScenarioDir"))
    NULL if ScenarioDir does not exist
  ScenarioConfig (snapshot of BaseModel$setting("ScenarioConfig") name)
    NULL if ScenarioConfig does not exist
  Option to create ScenarioDir and blank ScenarioConfig (create=TRUE)
  Option to force reload (fromFile) or skip file reload
Printing the scenarios object will say if scenarios are defined.
  [DONE] VEModelScenarios$initialize(BaseModel,create=FALSE,startFrom=NULL)
    BaseModel is required (search for ScenarioDir)
    Populate the scenario structure
      BaseModel, StartFrom, ScenarioDir, ScenarioConfig (nail it down at the moment of creation)
    If create==TRUE, build ScenarioDir and add ScenarioConfig
      Pull startFrom from BaseModel if create==TRUE and not provided (last Reportable stage)
    If create==FALSE, just consider what is (not) there
    Does $load if ScenarioDir exists or got created (ScenarioConfig may or may not exist)
  [DONE] VEModelScenarios$load(StartFrom=NULL,build=TRUE,scenarioPath=NULL)
    Option to (re)set "StartFrom" if provided (forces build to TRUE)
    Will load "scenarios.cnf" if it exists in ScenarioDir and extract "Scenarios" key
    If "Scenarios" key does not exist, create it and resave scenarios.cnf
      Contains ScenarioDir, StartFrom (may be reset during loading)
    Use Categories key if present, but don't build/create automatically
    Can optionally specify "build" to try constructing ModelStages
      Model stages will be rebuilt from what is in scenarios.cnf in this case
      If $build fails, report what is missing
      If $build succeeds
        replace ModelStages
        reload the baseModel (which will add the scenarios to its stages)
    Otherwise note in print/status that ModelStages have not been built
    If build==TRUE, also rewrite ScenarioDir/ScenarioConfig with any built changes.
  [DONE] VEModelScenarios$save(overwrite=FALSE)
    Save the in-memory scenario configuration back to ScenarioDir/ScenarioConfig
    Use as an alternative (and perhaps call from within) to the Save=TRUE option on $load, $files, $build
    Nuance the overwrite flag appropriately
  [DONE] VEModelScenarios$stages(scenarios=NULL)
    Return the built list of stages (or an empty list) as VEModelStage objects
    TODO: May filter that list by scenario (stage) name, perhaps also by category (just stages
      using a certain category) and further by level (just stages using a certain level)
  VEModelScenarios$run
    Dispatches to the model run, with option to list specific scenarios to run
      Scenarios to run are listed by name (see $stages object to get the names)
    Includes option to "save", "reset" or "continue" (with, in this case, "reset" being the default)
  VEModelScenarios$print()
    Indicate type of scenarios (folders, category-based)
    Indicate how many scenarios are defined
    List Folder-based scenarios
    List Categories/Levels, plus number of generated scenarios
  VEModelScenarios$inputs(scenario or category name; default all of them)
    Return StartFrom inputs that have been defined in the requested (default: ALL) scenario or categories
    Option to show all files (default for full scenario - looks at BaseModel/StartFrom inputs)
      or just those defined in the scenario/category (looks at files named in the category)
      For categories, will say if the file belongs to the category (perhaps also report levels in which the file actually exists)
      For scenarios, will say if the file exists in the scenario directory
    Validate category inputs - file can only occur in one category
    For directory based scenarios
  VEModelScenarios$fromCSV(CSVFile="scenario_categories.csv")
    # Simpler function just to parse CSV files set up the "old way" (see VEScenario)
    # Converts the spreadsheet into "Categories" key in the scenario description
    Read that file to determine categories to attach to the Input files
    Flag any inputs in the CSV that are not in the StartFrom Stage
    Return constructed "Category" key
    Return the Category_df from the CSV file
    If Save is true, save Category_df to CSVFile
    Don't change anything if the CSV does not have a valid configuration
  VEModelScenarios$categories(levels=FALSE)
    Return the Category names (for use, e.g. in examining inputs)
    If levels==TRUE, return a named list of character vectors
      Each list element is named for its category
      The character vector contains the names of the levels
    Usual workflow:
      Update the Category key (a nested named list, or via the CSV)
      Save the VEScenarios back out to to scenarios.cnf
      Re-load the scenarios object (build=TRUE)
  VEModelScenarios$build(Reset=FALSE,Save=TRUE)
    Main activity of "build" is to construct ModelStages from the scenarios identified in scenario.cnf
    Handle two types of scenarios (Categories and Folders)
      Process "Folders" first
      If "Categories" tag is present, holds a Category/Level structure
        Optional StartFrom as the first element of Categories; may refer to a Folder scenario
        Subsequent elements are names with Files and Levels
        Process the combinations into ModelStages structures
      if "ScenarioFolders" tag is present, is a list of directories to treat as scenarios
        else generate ScenarioFolders from sub-directories of ScenarioDir (like VEModel$configure)
        Process directories into ModelStages structures
    If Reset is TRUE:
      Ignore existing ModelStages - otherwise just check for additions/consistency
    If Save is TRUE
      Resave scenario.cnf with ModelStages added
    If Save is FALSE
      Just leave ModelStages in memory (for debugging/inspection)
    The "load" function turns the ModelStages description for the Scenarios into VEModelStage objects (after build)
    Folders are always processed first, then Categories
    If processing Folders:
      ModelStages will just use each of the ScenarioFolders as "StageDir" for the stages
      If the sub-directory has a visioneval.cnf, set StageConfig instead
      Names of sub-directories will be Names of scenario stages (must be unique relative to Model)
      All the ScenarioFolders will StartFrom the overall scenario StartFrom
      StartFrom need not be provided (in which case the Scenario folders must be runnable - error
        will be generated when we attempt to reload the model in which the scenarios live)
    If processing Categories
      CategoryStartFrom (can refer to a Folder scenario)
        Defaults to overall scenario StartFrom
        If provided, it must refer to the name of a Folder scenario within this scenario set
        If the name is not a folder within the scenario set, offer a warning and ignore it
        If no StartFrom available, then an error (missing "StartFrom")
      Categories structure is an array

      Proceed to complete the Category build (below)
    Complete the Category build: After doing table or config build setup, complete as follows:
      Validate categories:
        Each category must have at least one additional level
          StartFrom is the implied base scenario level for all categories
        Each category must specify at least one file
        Each file from StartFrom input must exist in at most one category
      Create any Category-Level folders that do not exist
        Make folders for each Category (create if not existing)
          Make folders for each Level (create if not existing)
      Install the Category files from StartFrom InputPath into each Level folder
        If the file is present, just skip it
        If a file not in the Category is present in a level, warn the user and stop the build
        If a file is not present, copy it from the StartFrom InputPath
      Build the ModelStages structure for Categories
        Make a Scenarios/ModelStage entry for each combination of Category-Level
        Name constructed from index of Category and Level (C1L2C2L3)
          The stages are just the scenarios
          The StartFrom stage corresponds to C1L0C2L0 but is not identifed that way
        Set up InputPath (vector of Category-Level folders), Scenario, Description, ScenarioDir (for output)
          # The ModelStages structure placed in the Model's Scenarios key:
          # Should end up defining for each scenario (ModelStage):
          #   Name (of stage; defaults to basename(Dir) )
          #   Dir (compound name for stage, for ResultsDir; or folder if scenario is folder-based )
          #   Scenario (or Name or basename(Dir)) - used for Query column headings
          #   Description (Category + Level Descriptions): could end up REALLY long...
          #   InputPath (compounded as path to CategoryLevel subdirectories relative to
          #     BaeModel$modelPath/ScenarioDir) - should normalize when Scenario stages are loaded.
          #   Reportable (always TRUE)
          #   Additional configuration can be provided by hand for Category scenarios
          #   Manual scenarios can be adjusted through their own visioneval.cnf
        Goes straight into ModelStages (rewrite ModelStages structure)
    If Save, rewrite scenarios.cnf
    If not Save, then just keep the scenario object up to date in memory (can call VEModelScenarios$save)

============================

  Scenario stages are appended after the last regular ModelStage (note that the scenarios are
  automatically considered Reportable, and we don't alter Reportable for any "StartFrom" stage).
  Also require unique names for the scenarios. If scenario configuration is broken, just do a
  warning. Warn if model has no scenarios at all.

  Helper functions for VEModelScenario. Figure out how to interact these with the "build"
    function: probably these should just help make templates.
  VEModelScenarios$categories()
    # Report if using directory-based (manual) scenarios
      # Each scenario folder is a "Category"
    # If category-based:
      # Report the Categories key from Scenarios key, if present, else "No categories defined"
  VEModelScenarios$list()
    # Reports the ModelStages (Scenario names, possibly with Description)
    # Works for both category-based and manual scenarios
    # Or should it report a vector of VEModelStages - the latter is more flexible
    #   and could support the internal operation of creating the group of scenarios
    #   to run.
    # Picking a "stage" for producing a directory or finding out about it should look
    #   not just into the model's intrinsic ModelStages but also into the Scenarios$ModelStages

  In the VEModel print function, we need to distinguish scenario model stages from those that
    are intrinsic to the base model. We can do that by factoring out ModelStages whose names
    are present/not present in the scenario list
