Installing VisionEval

Maintain a test library of R packages:

Also apparently wants github: tdhock/namedCapture

Installing knitr brings these along (knitr may only be needed during package building):
	package ‘mime’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘glue’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘magrittr’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘stringi’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘evaluate’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘highr’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘markdown’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘stringr’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘yaml’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘knitr’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

The visioneval framework package seems only to depend on knitr.
visioneval IMPORTS c("jsonlite","stringr","filesstrings","rhdf5")

Using "devtools" brings along some other dependencies:
	package ‘mime’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘curl’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

	package ‘jsonlite’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘git2r’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘withr’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked
	package ‘devtools’ successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked

require(devtools)
require(knitr) # used within build to generate documents
# from root of VisionEval-JR
build("sources/framework/visioneval","./built-packages")

# get list of modules
mlist <- dir("sources/modules")
mlist <- mlist[-grep("\\.",mlist)]
for (mod in mlist) {
	build(paste("sources/modules",mod,sep="/"),"./built-packages")
}

# How do we rebuild the manifest files in "sources/modules"?
