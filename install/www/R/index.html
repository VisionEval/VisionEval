<h1>VisionEval Package Repository</h1>

<p>Typically, you'll access this folder by pointing R at it as a
repository. Doing so manually is sort of pointless.</p>
<p>You can access it conveniently in R using the <code>repos="https://visioneval.jeremyraw.com/R/"</code>
parameter for <code>install.packages()</code>
or <code>available.packages()</code>.</p>
<p>Inspect the code for the installers for examples of its use.</p>


<H2>Important! This is <strong>NOT</strong> a complete clone of CRAN</H2>

<p>It is just the subset (of CRAN, BioConductor and Github) needed
to install and run VisionEval.</p>
<p>It includes source and windows binary versions of the required
packages (the binary versions are compiled to the version of R linked
on <a href="/">the home page of this site</a>).</p>

Source packages: "<a href="src/">src/</a>"<br/>
Windows Binary packages: "<a href="bin/">bin/</a>"
