Need to separate the "build" step from the "install" step.
We want to build packages that we can put into an R repository.
Then the installation for an end user just installs the packages
	Ideally windows binaries
	Otherwise from source
	Installing from source requires knitr and its dependencies
We want to have an online (and offline-able) repository with the built packages.
We can have the user run a script from a remote website that will install the needed packages
	Can work from the remote
	If we can't access the remote via the Internet, then offer to search for a local download directory
	Have download instructions on the website
	Instructions should be at the VisionEval/install home page
	Run R.  Source the installer.
	Completely local installation (download miniCRAN)

From the "built-packages" folder, this command installs visioneval and builds the Windows binary:
R CMD INSTALL --build ../sources/framework/visioneval

Behind the scenes have the ability to rebuild the installer (miniCRAN)
Have simple instructions to erect an internet-accessible repository
	
Re-do the MiniCRAN build script.
