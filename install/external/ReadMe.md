This folder contains items that need to be installed but are not built
as part of VisionEval itself.  There are some scripts that will bring
in and build external components:

* namedCapture (Github package required for VEGUI)
* rsync (developer tool; only needed for website synchronization)

We could put installers for consistent versions of R and Rtools for
Windows here if we decide not to track the current R release for some
reason.
