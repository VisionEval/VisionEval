# Identify VisionEval Components and Dependencies

Components:

# "Type: module" components are built and installed as R packages
# "Type: framework" works like a module, but is built first; also it has a different implied
#        documentation location
# The test script(s) are copied to the "tools/tests/<PackageName> folder
#   Though many packages include tests/scripts they have not been maintained
#   Also, there are cross dependencies. What should be listed here are
#   files that create functions that will run tests (they can reach back into
#   the package for related information) - more to come on that
# The group captures the VE internal dependencies and is used to establish the order of building
#   Module packages are built in order by their Group number, and with Group in the order they are listed here
#   Group 0 will typically be framework module packages (visioneval, VEModel)
#   Group 1 are those without dependencies
#   Group 2 depend on Group 1 packages
#   Group 3 depend on Group 2 etc (if any)
# Docs target is one (or a vector) of locations from which markdown files will be processed into PDFs
#   Build target PDFs will be placed in a name derived (for the framework) from the first element in the  Docs path,
#   and (for the modules) in a folder named after the module:
#       framework [Type]:
#       +api # contains any .md files found at the top level as PDFs
#       +function_docs # contains any .md files found in the indicated folder as PDFs
#       modules
#       + [ModuleName] # contains inst/module_docs as PDFs

#    To build properly, need to do externals after creating ve.lib!
#    which requires a change to the Makefile sequencing.
#    The CRAN version of packages should be used when possible.
