For initializing models

  Add an "initialize" mode for model running that stops after the inputs have been loaded and
  the Initialize.R modules have been run.

  Re-architect to push initialize functionality into Initialize<Module> functions, and add
  in the package a table of initialize functions and what order to call them.

  Should have loaded inputs prior to running initialize modules.

  Capture and expose errors (perhaps just for this run mode, increase default log level to
  "debug"). A lower level can be explicitly requested.

  A model stage that was run with "initialize" should save its output to some place other
  than the ResultsDir - define another sub-directory of the model for that purpose so
  we can inspect the pieces. Then it won't conflict with a subsequent model run (which will
  always do initialize again, without the higher level of logging unless explicitly requested).

  Consider fixing some of the Initialize issues during that re-architecting.

For documentation

  Continue documenting VEModel functionality - find some useful way to do that beyond the tests/walkthrough
  (Or perhaps by adding comments to those or doing a separate .md/.Rmd that goes over it.

  Go back over the walkthrough elements and make sure they're still correct and working.

  Complete basic Roxygen descriptions (a bit tricky for R6 classes)

For scenarios

  See plan-scenario.txt - key item are model stage scenarios working with a single
  category listing all the scenarios.

For the visualizer:

  see plan-scenario.txt (setting up inputs) and plan-visualizer.txt

  Mostly done - can remove some of the previous samples since it all appears to work.

  Consider updating the bootstrap and other javascript libraries (may need to do some
  work to make it all functional).

For build/install restructuring:

  See plan-build.txt

  Includes TestWith architecture.

For local data estimation task:

  See plan-estimate.txt

For building visioneval and models:

  From a model's run script, generate an empty set of input table specifications in some arbitrary output format
  (default in-memory data.frame). This would be the "skeleton" function.

  # Generate skeleton files for models and model stages

    Inside the model, have a "structure" sub-directory that we can create and populate on demand by
    exporting model metadata

    It should list the model contents based on the AllSpecs_ls structure, focusing on the Inp and Set
    specifications for each of the models.

    Could also generate that by digging into the dataset attributes in the Datastore (where they
    ride around). The SQL implementation of a Datastore will maintain the Datastore index table
    that has all the attributes for each G/T/N.

    More reliable to generate from AllSpecs since the Datastore may not exist yet.

    Add a structure function that will list input and output fields (evolution of list/index
    functions). Generates a data.frame that we can export. Option to saveTo creates CSV files where
    tables are input files or G/T/N and their names are the names they have either in inputs or in
    the datastore, and their rows are the various metadata items from the specification.

    visioneval can furnish an exportDataFrame function that takes format, connection, location and
    that simply delegates to the format's version of that function. Can perhaps explity that within
    VEModel to avoid having to mess with the format directly...

For running models:

  Add a "Workers" parameter for VE settings, defaulting to 1 (single-threading).
  Make the "plan" operation more flexible to allow setting more elaborate future plans.

  BUG: When re-running the walkthrough with files already built in another directory, the Datastore
  path ends up wrong. TODO: when we open a ModelState.Rda in a particular working directory, we need
  to look at the actual location of ModelState and the current ve.runtime path and relocate the
  Datastore path in the ModelState.Rda (otherwise it craps out because the path is wrong). When
  loading the ModelState, identify key paths (like DatastorePath) that may be relative to ModelDir,
  and update ModelDir to the parent of ResultsDir and replace throughout.  

For extraction:

  Two parts: extract (which builds a data.frame or list thereof) and export (which writes to an
  output using a data formatter API. Extract is, in effect, an internal function (export has an
  option to dish up data.frames in memory).

  Implement two functions for extracting Datastores: extract and export.

  extract
    Operates on a set of Group/Table/Name (given a ModelStage with its Datastore)
      Produces a list of unit-converted data.frames (selecting only named Group, Table or Name)
      Uses readDatastoreTables
        Does unit conversion plus field subsetting
        Auto-generatea the bizarre structure required for readDatastoreTables
    Basic structure tracks with current VEResults$extract, except we generate a list of
      data.frames - this will apply to results from one model stage
    Export iterates over Group/Table/Name and extracts, then writes the data.frame (so we
      don't put them all in memory at once). export passes Group and Table explicitly to extract.
    Extract only exists for a ModelStage - for a model, it's just (as currently) an alias for export
      but possibly with a different configuration of default parameters (e.g. extract will do all
      stages, whereas export only does Reportable or perhaps vice versa)
  export
    Applied to a ModelStage will iterate over requested Group/Table/Name in the specified format
      Extracts each Group/Table to a data.frame then writes a table to the connection
        specified in the output format.
      Default is to iterate over all Groups. Group can be a specific name or the shortcut "Years"
        whic is set (internally or externally) via a selection
      Writes one Table per Group formatting the output table as ModelStage_Group_Table
      Output location has "connection" (directory) and "table" (ModelState_Group_Table name)
      Default directory is RunPath/OutputDir
    Applied to a Model will visit each requested ModelStage (default=Reportable) and export it
      After configuring the selection for the ModelStage per the function arguments for Group,
        Table, Field
    Export needs a directory to write into (default is ResultsDir/OutputDir for the model,
      or RunPath/OutputDir if just working on a single ModelStage

  When selecting stages for output from the model, can use shortcut "Scenarios" to refer to all
  scenario model stages (only, including the StartFrom stage).

  # Establish internal API via framework for export functions

    Framework has visioneval::getFileFormat() with parameters "format" and "role"
      Internally, search for "VEoutputFormats" as a function in each VE package named in an
      "OutputFormats" setting (a vector of package name that provide VEOutputFormats). The
      framework provides a default for that setting, but will also hunt up other packages
      using the mechanism applied for adding more settings.

    So we will call (in "export") visioneval::getDataFormat("csv","output")
      Can also provide a list instead of the name (name looks up in list of known formats,
      list provides an actual format implementation).
      That yields a list with "writeDataFrame" as a named element, and the element is
        a function, as specified below

    The "output" format returns a named list of one function:
      "writeDataFrame" which takes "connection" and "location"
      For "csv", "connection" is directory, "location" is file name (.csv extension forced)
      perhaps have a "..." on the writeDataFrame definition where a particular driver can
      specify and accept additional parameters (for csv, the "extension" and perhaps any
      the options passed to the write.csv function.

    File-based export will make a location in ResultsDir/outputs. Subfolder will be created as
      export_<Timestamp>. Filename will be Scenario_Group_Table.fileformat.
    Do we need the outputFormat complicity to create the sub-directory? Timestamp may be part
      what we provide to the writeDataFrame.

  # Full implementation of file formats for export

    Add a DBI format for "output" (wrangle connection issues)

      Dispatch through functions that will:
        Establish a connection to the "database" (directory, "Export_<Timestamp>", Database name)
          Wrapper function interprets "directory" as connection
        DBI::writeTable using the Scenario_Group_Table name (with double underscore for database)
          Make a wrapper function that takes a data.frame and puts it into a table with the
            given name (sanitized with double underscores as needed)
        Metadata for the tables can also be generated (the way the current export does it 

      I think we can't support "DBI" in general. Instead, we support specific DBI drivers Thus MY
      (MariaDB/MySQL), PG (PostgreSQL), SS (SQL Server), OR (Oracle), SL (SQLite), etc.

      Database-based will create a Database using the connection information (but DBI doesn't
      directly support creating a database in some back-ends; connection may require an existing
      database - report a gentle error if exporting to such a thing). Probably want to instruct the
      user to pre-create the database (default=<ModelName>_outputs). Or we could use a generic
      connection to the database engine and run SQL to create the database and set permissions.

      Uses a filename template to name the DBI/output table. The "directory" says where to make the
      table. File-system default is RunPath/outputs/export_<Timestamp>. DBI default is a database
      that should already exist (stands in for "export_<Timestamp>"). But for SQLite specifically,
      which can create a new database, it will be created as
      RunPath/outputs/export_<Timestamp>.sqlite.

      Tablename in all cases contains Scenario__Group__Table. Or we could just use the forward
      slash naming and force all database requests to use constructed names with the suitable
      quote character ([], `` or whatever the database supports, falling back on double underscore).
      Another option is the $ which in most SQL's can be used unquoted. But I like quoting the
      forward slash so we can specify Scenario/Group/Table that way.
      
    Other formats
      csv, alt.csv, feather, excel (just for "output")
        Excel creates a workbook for the "connection" and a worksheet for the "location"
      mysql, access, sqlite, sqlserver, oracle, postgresql (for "output" and "datastore")

  # Structure of a format object

    Data format class needs "open" and "close" functions used both for Datastore implementation and
    export functions. Need to ensure connections are opened and closed properly. Can use R
    connections for csv or feather package, though feather only does filenames in its functions, not
    R connections.

    Only the Datastore really benefits from keeping the connection open. But still, we should
    have a low-level open and close function for use internally (and in implementing export
    functions).

    Three levels of functions for a data format:

    [internal]
      open
      close
      VE settings unique for this driver (e.g. Password, User)
      connection information (if open, connection/location; if not open - previous values of those)
      Should be to use connection information to reopen the data format
    [export]
      writeDataFrame
    [Datastore]
      # existing
      initDatastore    # initial setup (create database)
                       # should create the Datastore connection summary
                       # which gets saved in "Datastore" in "RunPath"
      initTable        # set up to make a table (can demand a certain length)
                       # will check length if table exists and make a variant
                       # if it's wrong
      initDataset      # prepare a column in the table
      readFromTable    # get datasets (columns) in a list
      writeToTable     # write a dataset to a table
                       # it might be interesting to cache these requests
                       # so we can do an entire table at once.
      listDatastore    # update the metadata directory for the Datastore
                       # maintain a parallel list in the ModelState_ls

      # new
      openDatastore         # ! Could replace assignDatastoreFunctions
                            # Hook function, called once when loading ModelState
                            # opportunity to find database, provide user credentials, etc
                            # may cache connection
                            # Returns the connection so we can manage it externally
      closeDatastore        # another hook function to clear up connection
                            # call after model run, or after any access that occurs
                            # such as for loadDatastore or checking into it (e.g. for
                            # a query). Need to figure out all the "close bracket" locations
      readFullTable         # Takes Group / Table, returns fields (subset as parameter)
                            # efficient table access for table-based sources
                            # How does this differ from "readFromTable"
      getDatasetAttributes  # Takes Group / Table / Name and finds the internal
                            # location for attributes and returns the set
                            # DBI will have a magic table (possibly an extension
                            # of the DatastoreListing)
      relocateDatastore     # does nothing for RD or H5 but supports renaming a
                            # database using timestamp or serial number
                            # used for distributed Datastore if ResultsDir is copied somewhere

      Need ModelState to track relocation of model and its result directories, if we're copying
      models along with their results or if we're archiving results. Need to look at all the
      full paths like RunPath and swap out the ModelDir (just a sub operation across the full
      set of ModelState plus RunParam_ls, including the ModelDir itself).

  # Start wider implementation of file format back ends

    Put "csv" implementation in the framework

    Create "ViEIO" for the basic output implementation (a good DBI implementation could then
    work with anything - user just has to provide the connection function...).

    Additional options (put each in its own little package - a series of VEIO_<format> packages)
      Name is conventional, not required; framework will search all packages in the VE manifest
      alternate csv implementation using the more elaborate csv package
      feather file format
      Those packages will be dependent on the underlying implementation (RMariaDB, feather, etc)

    A VEio_<format> package is allowed to add VE settings (so we can configure things for the
      format). That would be delicious for stuff like a database user or password. That would
      argue for making the format itself into an R6 object with a standard interface (use
      R6 inheritance?). For the "csv" package, that would mean the output file format. The
      parameter name should refer to its specific package, so it is clear we're configuring
      "csv" output.

    Could OPTIONALLY make the "output" format an R6 object (and might even be transparent if we
      standardize the function calls as formatObject$writeDataFrame(...) (same syntax embrackes a
      list or an environment).

    When a format is first accessed (visioneval::getDataFormat), there should be a standard
      hook called (present in the formatObject) called "initializeFormat") with a ...
      set of parameters (e.g. for DBI, we will pass the name of the database to use, whether
      to blow away or use existing or abort, and perhaps also send credentials that will
      get cached in the in-memory version fothe format). If we do an R6 implementation,
      it will create an object that the framework will keep available for later format calls.
    The initializeFormat is called internally, and it will use format RunParameter defaults for
      anything not provided, or give an error explaining what needs to be configured (via settings)

  # expand Datastore Functions API for to support different Datastore types

    It would be wild to implement a Datastore connection to Excel. Could we do a generic
      ODBC connection? That would make the connection setup external to VisionEval, but
      would probably be really messy. Native excel would be better. Might have to use
      ODBC to get at MS Access.

    The different Datastore type looks totally doable! Just make sure to handle the
      "copy datastore" functionality for archiving to ensure that non-local storage also
      gets relocated.

    The connection used for a Datastore belongs to the ModelStage. That implies one
    connection for the Datastore we're writing, and one for each of the Datastores we might be
    reading - we'll cache those efficiently when we first start reading Datastores. Those
    connections can be to the same database, but it gives the option to do one database per
    ModelStage / Scenario and not have to screw with table prefixes. SQL can easily have lots
    of databases. SQL syntax references both db and table as `db_name.table_name`. We can use
    that to pull from a different database...

    Separate from the model state, do we want to cache the RunParams_ls into the Datastore?
    Probably don't cache database passwords: use the my.cnf approach to cache passwords,
    Otherwise the dataFormat should always send password requests back to the user (and
      crap out if non-interactive). Don't allow saving passwords as a VE setting.

    initializeFormat applies regardless of "role" for format (output,datastore)

    datastore role be used for DatastoreType (should have a function to return "shortcode")
      So we'll look up the shortcode to map to the long format name for getDataFormat

    Datastore functions:
      initDatastore    # initial setup (create/open database)
                       # should create the Datastore connection summary
                       # check that the Datastore is available, clean (no tables)
                       # and create it if necessary
      initTable        # set up to make a table (can demand a certain length)
                       # will check length if table exists and make a variant
                       # if it's wrong
      initDataset      # prepare a column in the table
      readFromTable    # get datasets (columns) in a list
      writeToTable     # write a datset to a table
      listDatastore    # update the metadata directory for the Datastore

    May need a function hook for opening an existing Datastore (so for DBI,
      we'll look into the RunPath "Datastore" file - there will always be
      one of those - and get the connection information from that file; user
      will have to provide the password)

    Rewrite existing readDatabaseTables to use framework functions sensibly.
      Pass through readFullTable (below) which can be implemented differently
      for different formats.

    The RD and H5 are Dataset(column)-based. The DBI implementation will be easier if we push the
      readDatastoreTables functionality (for queries) into the "datastore" format role, the
      top-level function uses some new DatastoreFunctions to make that work efficient:

        openDatastore         # Hook function, called once when loading ModelState
                              # opportunity to find database, provide user credentials, etc
                              # may cache connection
                              # Returns the connection so we can manage it externally
        closeDatastore        # another hook function to clear up connection
                              # call after model run, or after any access that occurs
                              # such as for loadDatastore or checking into it (e.g. for
                              # a query). Need to figure out all the bracket locations
        readFullTable         # Takes Group / Table, returns fields (subset as parameter)
                              # efficient table access for table-based sources
        getDatasetAttributes  # Takes Group / Table / Name and finds the internal
                              # location for attributes and returns the set
                              # DBI will have a magic table (possibly an extension
                              # of the DatastoreListing)
        relocateDatastore     # does nothing for RD or H5 but supports renaming a
                              # database using timestamp or serial number

    Need additional functions to manage datastore moving elsewhere
      When we archive results, we'll copy the ResultsDir, but we'll also call a
        hook function with a Timestamp (or serial number) to rename the existing
        database (and then do name disambiguation - it has to be new).
        function: outputFormat$relocateDatastore
      In DBI that will create a new timestamped/serial-numbered database into which
        all the tables get copied. It will also mean rewriting the connection
        information into the actual Datastore file.

    All formats will maintain a Datastore file in the RunPath, even for possibly
      non-local formats like server-based DBMS. FOr "access" and "sqlite", the
      "Datastore" is the database file, as for H5.
    Non-local formats contain connection information. That's important because we
      may not be using the same credentials if we open the model somewhere else.
    Password is not retained (only user): set caching up through the database's own mechanisms.
      Prompt the user for a password if model is running interactively, otherwise "stop" with
      error.

    In general, for export, a DBI-based (non-local) Datastore should be "flattened"
      into a file-based format. That's a workflow thing.

    Should we have a workflow for changing existing model's DatastoreType in place
      without having to re-run? Would entail archiving the existing results, then
      setting the new DatastoreType and copying each ModelState results back into
      place with the new type attached. Would need to update the ModelState and
      its RunParam_ls.

    Of course, if we try to open a model state with a missing DatastoreType, we
      have to give an error message

  # For efficiency, consider building all the model stage's tables up front

    Create a hook for the Datastore ( createAllTables ) called up front and passing in
      some sensible structure based on the "Set" specifications for all the modules -
      draw out each Group/Table and make sure all the written columns are accounted for
    We would do that right as we initialize the Datastore listing...
    We'll be investigating the Datastore index to determine whether a particular field is
      in a certain Group/Table (or whether the Group/Table even exists). That's what
      triggers a search up the DatastorePath.
    We still have the initTable hook used in its current location, and it will simply
      be ignore if createAllTables got there first.

    We have all the "set" specifications as the model is being initialized for a run
    There is already a place in the specification where we look at group and table initialization.
    So couldn't we just make the tables correctly?
    Only issue would be their "length", and the fact that the VERPAT mis-design creates "new tables'
      on the fly. Length is just a matter of what rows we write.
    Some formats like H5 need to know the length up front, so perhaps they get a delayed table write
    Of course, SQL is row-based, not column based, so we'll always need to be reading the key field
      and doing an update of one column linked by key field.    

  # Updates to VEmodel$dir - handle queries better, plus all the Datastore output formats above for
    results

    In doing VEModel$dir, we'll iterate over the ModelStages in case they have different
      DatastoreTypes. We should get more information about where the data is stored.

      For DBI Datastore support
        Database is construcated as <VEModel$modelName>_Results_<Timestamp>
          # Timestamp is when initialized
        Tables are prefixed with StageDir__
        Rest of table name is Group__Table
        Create a StageDir__DatastoreListing table for each ModelStage

  # DBI Interace

    https://db.rstudio.com/advanced/backend

    For DBI, work one database per model. Prefix ScenarioDir__ then Group__Table to construct
    a Datastore table. Maintain ScenarioDir__DatastoreListing metadata table.

    In a DBI implementation, need to make a hack to support VERPAT: create a pseudo-table to support
    fields with different lengths written into the "same" Vehicles table): if we write the wrong
    number of rows, create an alternate table (suffix on table name of "__<Length>") and maintain a
    mapping table that says if this Table gets a column of a certain length it gets written into
    into the table with the appropriate index (pick the table based on the number of rows being
    written).
    In the DatastoreListing, we can update the target length of the table (that's an init parameter
    in any case, so we should be good for checking).

    We could be fancy in the DatastoreListing and list the TableName as a given (the one used
    by VisionEval) for writing. Then map to the actual DB table, which can be different, and pick
    the correct table base on its TableName and its Length (compared to the dataset being written
    in - so we can create a different Group/DBTable for differen Table/Length. On extract/export
    it becomes just another table (doing the hack-mapping that we otherwise had to do explicitly).
    So the hack/reconciliation happens when the table is created or written to, not when it is
    retrieved.

    Wrap DBI with the VisionEval datastore functions. We would need to provide connection information
    and we can do that quasi-automatically for DBI-based types by adding some RunParam_ls options to
    describe the Datastore connection (so if DatastoreType=="DBI" then we need DatastoreConnection
    specified). There may or may not be a Datastore object in the file system in that case.
    "DatastoreName" can be the connection information; for file-based approaches like SQLite the file
    name is relative to RunPath. In DBI, make the Scenario/Group/Table separator a setting that defaults to
    something like a doubled underscore. Keep a table of known scenarios and groups - force a lookup
    check if something that doesn't exist is requested.

    The DatastorePath looks at RunPaths to find the ModelState. The ModelState has the DatastoreType
    and DatastoreName (connection information), the latter is (if file-system based) always relative
    to the Model Stage RunPath.

    Grapple here with the bug that says if we try to open model results after the ModelDir/ve.runtime
    is changed, we can still find the Datastore etc. So we probably need to store the path components
    separately and make a parameter for opening a ModelState that provides an alternate ModelDir and
    rebuilds RunPath etc when the ModelState is opened.

    For using DBI, user just needs to install driver package and provide a connection. Try it out with
    Access/ODBC, sqlite, and (on the home machine) MariaDB.

    Also, option to export into R data.frames or perhaps data.tables using the same structure.

    Then look at dbplyr ("designed to work with database tables as if they were local data.frames").

Structurally turn vignettes into docs

  Start with model packages to figure it out

  Model package contains:
    bare model
    sample model
    vignettes (module_docs here? Tutorial for model)
    R directory with extra modules (see VETravelDemandMM or VERPAT)
    man for modules/module_docs - integrate all that better

  Turn module_docs into regular docs (vignettes)

For building vignettes:
